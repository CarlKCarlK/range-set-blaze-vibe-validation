`Algo C` reimplementation that mirrors the production Rust insertion logic
while operating directly on the `NR` and `RangeSetBlaze` structures.

STATUS: Migrating away from unsafe constructors. Core invariant proofs COMPLETE!

COMPLETED (Session 10):
- ok_deleteExtraNRs: COMPLETE with hstop gap precondition
- ok_deleteExtraNRs_loop: COMPLETE (strong version requiring Pairwise (current :: pending))
- ok_deleteExtraNRs_loop_weak: COMPLETE (weak version requiring only Pairwise pending)
- ok_internalAdd2NRs: COMPLETE with gap hypothesis (either before = [] or last has gap < start)
- all_before_strict_before_start: Helper to propagate gap to all elements

COMPLETED (Session 11):
- Fixed unused variable warning in ok_deleteExtraNRs
- Created internalAdd2_safe: Safe wrapper using ok_internalAdd2NRs with fromNRs
- Moved internalAddC definition to after internalAdd2_safe (line 1134)
- **Proved span_le_empty_implies_lt_empty**: Bridging lemma showing (≤ start) empty → (< start) empty
- **Explored predicate unification** (Increment 8): Requires ~15-20 proof sections to be rewritten
- **Created internalAdd2_safe_from_le** (Increment 9): Wrapper accepting (≤) gaps and converting to (<)
- **Wired into internalAddC** (Increment 9): Both `none` and `some prev with gap` branches now use safe constructor

Current status: 3 sorrys (was 2)
- Line 60: mkNRUnsafe (intentional, to be eliminated)
- Line 67: fromNRsUnsafe (intentional, to be eliminated)
- Line ~1207: internalAdd2_safe_from_le conversion (new, needs proof)
- Line ~1241: getLast? = some prev → getLast hne = prev (new, small lemma needed)

The gap hypothesis in ok_internalAdd2NRs matches the actual call sites in internalAddC:
  - none case: before = [] (gap holds vacuously) ✅ WIRED
  - some prev with gap: prev.val.hi + 1 < start (gap provided directly) ✅ WIRED (with sorry)

NEXT STEPS:

**Immediate (to get back to 2 sorrys):**
1. Prove getLast? = some x → getLast hne = x (simple List lemma)
2. Prove (≤) last with gap → (<) last with gap in internalAdd2_safe_from_le
   - Key insight: prev.hi + 1 < start implies prev.lo < start
   - Need to show prev is in the (<) split and is its last element

**Then:**
3. Fix broken proofs in internalAddC_correct (they reference old internalAdd2 calls)
4. Consider making extend-prev branch safe too (uses fromNRsUnsafe currently)

Current unsafe constructors (to eventually remove):
- mkNRUnsafe (line 39): Creates NR without proof
- fromNRsUnsafe (line 46): Creates RangeSetBlaze without Pairwise proof

/-- Invariant preservation: `deleteExtraNRs` maintains `Pairwise NR.before`.The proof structure:
- Span xs into (before, after) at start
- If after is empty: result is xs, trivially Pairwise
- If after = curr :: tail:
  * Construct initial range from curr.lo to max curr.hi stop
  * Apply ok_deleteExtraNRs_loop to (initial, tail)
  * Combine: need Pairwise on (before ++ loop_result)
    - This requires showing that all elements of before are ≺ to loop_result.fst
    - Key: before all have lo < start, initial.lo = curr.lo ≥ start (from span property)
    - From Pairwise on original xs, last of before is ≺ curr
